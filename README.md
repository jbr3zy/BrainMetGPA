**BrainMetGPA** is a tool that helps provide a diagnosis-specific estimate of survival for patients with brain metastases. _Actual outcomes for individual patients can vary widely_.

It uses the algorithm developed for the [**Graded Prognostic Assesment (GPA)**](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/4/419) as part of the research study by Paul Sperduto, et al.

The web app itself was design to serve as a mobile _Web Clip_ for iPhone. Thanks to:
